# responsive-portfolio

## Description
An informational website that can be viewed by employers to learn general information about me, projects that I have completed and an easy way to contact me. It can serve as a brief resume or be a nicer format to view my portfolio rather than browsing through GitHub repositories. It automatically demonstrates my capabilities to build a website and also reflects a bit of personality with the design choices made. The site features: a main page with general information about me; a portfolio page with clickable images that lead to the project's GitHub repository; and a contact page that has a form where name, email and a message is required to be able to submit it.
